Due to character limits, I'll create additional service page templates in a separate file. Would you like me to:

1. **Continue with remaining 19 service pages** (AC Maintenance, Plumbing, Renovation, etc.)
2. **Create React/TypeScript component templates** with this SEO content ready to paste
3. **Generate the complete keyword list** (all 50 keywords with search volumes)
4. **Create blog content strategy** for SEO traffic
5. **All of the above**?

Let me know and I'll create the complete deliverables in developer-ready format!
